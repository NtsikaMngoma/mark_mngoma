#### Intro
I am a co-founder and the CTO of [Merge•Africa](https://merge.africa) where I work on engineering infrastructure and build tools to price fine art. My primary job functions are as a DevOps and software engineer.
<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in social impact, education, inclusively, and financial planning. I enjoy advising companies and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in Durban, Kloof but travel to the Sandton Central Business District Area frequently.
<br><br>
#### Currently
At Merge•Africa I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models for production environments. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications (see [merge.africa](https://merge.africa)).

#### Some History

- My dear mother put a computer in my bedroom in 2004 when I was 7 years old . It was an old LG that ran Windows XP. My favorite games were Grand Theft Auto 3, Solitaire, and Hitman. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- Let's just skip to 2015, because I have never enjoyed school, one of the most disturbing 12 years of my life, lest I got standard achievements from it, especially for someone who hated school.

- In the summer of 2015, my sister abandoned her Acer that ran Intel Celeron, on which I learnt bash scripting, because I mean, it was slow : (. The Netflix and movies on a USB kinda computer. 

- At the age of 18, I built my first website with generic PHP scripting code, a fully fledged e-commerce application, it was not bad at the time, but it isn't fit enough to be on my github repo :) .

- At 20, I began developing and maintaining enterprise systems [here](https://merge.africa/).

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
